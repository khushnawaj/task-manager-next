/* Short security & operational notes
 - Cookie: set secure:true and sameSite=strict in production with HTTPS.
 - CORS: limit origins in production.
 - Validate inputs on all endpoints (schema validation like Joi recommended).
 - Rate-limit AI endpoints to prevent abuse.
 - Do not send PII to third-party LLMs; sanitize before forwarding.
 - Use HTTPS, helmet, and proper logging in production.
